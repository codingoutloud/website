%% create mermaid diagram that has a circle with a venn diagram within it - the outer circle is labeled "devX" - and the venn diagram has three overlapping/intersecting circles with these labels: "Security", "Azure", and "AI" - with each overlapping the others, and also an overlapping of all three. The overlapping of all three is labeled "Bill" and the overlap of Azure and AI is "AzureAI"

graph LR
subgraph AI ["Security"]
   subgraph ML ["DevX"]
      subgraph NN ["UX"]
         subgraph DL ["Azure"]
            subgraph GenAI ["AI"]
            end
         end
      end
      subgraph RL ["DevY"]
      end
   end
end
